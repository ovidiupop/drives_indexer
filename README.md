# Drives Indexer

Index your entire drive collection in one place and find anything in seconds!

If you're like me and have a big collection of old drives where you keep all your history, documents, work, pictures, favorite music, and movies, then you never know exactly where to find them when you need them.  
That’s why Drives Indexer was created. Now, you can find anything in a second!

## How does it work?

1. Mount your drive on your computer or use an external USB adapter or docking station. Yes, you can also index flash drives!  
   The application will automatically identify the newly added drive once it’s connected to your computer.

2. In the **Drives** tab, you need to add each indexable drive. Select it from the list and click the **Add** button.

3. Add your desired folders (or the entire drive) in the **Folders** tab. When you add a folder, the indexer will automatically start scanning the drive and index its files. In the **Preferences** tab, you can choose to start indexing manually.

   **Important!** If the folder to be scanned is very large or the drive is idle, it may take a few moments to start! Don’t worry!

4. You have to index each drive in your collection.  
   By default, the application is set to index only files with the most common extensions, grouped by categories. But you can also add any other extensions you prefer. Or, you can set it to index everything from the **Preferences** tab!  
   Even if you have the same folder structure on multiple drives, the application will identify them individually. This way, you’ll always know the exact location of your files.

5. You can search for terms that identify your files. The results will be displayed in the **Search Results** table. Here, you can sort them as you like.  
   File details are easy to view, and some even have a preview. Just double-click the line!

6. If you want to export the results to a CSV file, you have two options:
   - Export all results
   - Export only selected results

7. After you finish indexing, you can check for duplicates that take up unnecessary space and export the results to a CSV file.

**That’s all!**  
Happy searching!
