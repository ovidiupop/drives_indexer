<h1>Search</h1>

<p>In the Search tab you can find the files you want!</p>

<p>If you have indexed your folders, enter your search term, press Enter, or click the Search button.</p>

<p>If you wish to search only for a specific category of files, you can uncheck the rest of categories.</p>

<p>You can sort results as you wish, clicking on the table's header.</p>

<p>If some of the results belong to a drive which is not mounted, the name of that drive will be red.</p>

<p>If the results belong to a mounted drive, with a double click on the table line you can quickly see information about each file. Many files also have preview.</p>
