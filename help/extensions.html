<h1>Extensions</h1>

<p>Because is useless to index everything, there is a list of extensions for desired files.</p>

<p>These are grouped by categories.</p>

<p>By default there are 140 of extensions which will cover most preferred files. But if you will not need to find files related to programming for example, you can remove all the extensions from that category.</p>

<p>The number of indexed files is related to the number of extensions. If you wish to keep a small database, you can "clean" unwanted extensions.<br>
In this case, the indexed files with those extensions, will be removed from database.</p>

<p>Or, the other case, if you need to record and find a type of files with an extension which is not in the default list, you can add its extension anytime to the proper category.<br>
After you add a new extensions, the indexer will start immediately and will search and reindex all the folders only for that extension and only the folders with connected drives.
    For the other drives you will have to reindex the entire folders after you will connect the drives.</p>

<p>If you remove all extensions from a category, the category itself will not be removed but will stay empty and available (for the case you change your mind).</p>

<p>Adding of new extension is not possible during indexing process!</p>
