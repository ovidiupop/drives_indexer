<h1>Folders</h1>

<p>In the Folders tab happen the magic.</p>

<p>Here you need to select the folders you want to index. Click Add to add a new folder. After you select a folder in the File Manager, it will be added to the list and indexing will start automatically, unless you have changed this behavior in the Preferences tab.</p>
<p>If you wish to add multiple folders and index them in a single indexing, you have to uncheck 'Run indexer when new folder is added' from Preferences tab.</p>

<p>If you selected to index a very large folder, there will be a lag of some seconds until will start. You will know that the indexer is working as long as the buttons are disabled and the 'Stop index' button is visible.</p>

<p>While the files are indexed, you will see the progress in the status bar from any tab (and in the information area under the list in Folders tab).</p>

<p>If you decide to remove some folders, the indexed content of them will be removed from database, and you will not find anymore any references to them.<br>
You can remove more folders at once. Select those folders and click on Remove.<br>
If you wish to completely clean your database, you can use Remove All button. This will remove all folders and the files indexed.</p>

<p>If for any reason you need to reindex one or more folders, you have to select them and then click on Re/Index button. Previous records will be removed and the folders will be re-indexed.</p>

<p>During the indexing process, all operations which can affect the result will be blocked. You will not be able to add/remove folders, and also you will not be able to remove/add extensions.</p>

<p>If for any reason you need to stop the indexer while it is indexing, you will have to reindex the folder. In the Status column a red exclamation sign will be shown!</p>
