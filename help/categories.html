<h1>Categories</h1>


<p>Sometime is not necessary to find all files but some of specific type.</p>
<p>Here the categories are involved.</p>

<p>Each category have a number of specific extensions related to it.</p>
<p>For example, in Spreadsheet category there are next extensions: ods, xls, xlsm, xlsx. <br>
If we wish to find only the files which have one of these extensions, we can limit the search only to Spreadsheet category.<p>

<p>In the Categories tab you can select the preferred ones. Those which will be automatically used when you search. What you will select here, will save to database.<p>

<p>In the Search tab, you can refine your categories, checking or unchecking some of them. That selection will be temporary and will not be saved to database.<p>
